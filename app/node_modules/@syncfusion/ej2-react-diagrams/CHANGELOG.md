### Diagram

The diagram component visually represents information. It is also used to create diagrams like flow charts, organizational charts, mind maps, and BPMN either through code or a visual interface.


- **Nodes** - Nodes are used to host graphical objects (path or controls) that can be arranged and manipulated on a diagram page. Many predefined standard shapes are included. Custom shapes can also be created and added easily.
- **Connectors** - The relationship between two nodes is represented using a connector.
- **Labels** - Labels are used to annotate nodes and connectors.
- **Interactive Features** - Interactive features are used to improve the run time editing experience of a diagram.
- **Data Binding** - Generates diagram with nodes and connectors based on the information provided from an external data source.
- **Commands** - Supports a set of predefined commands that helps edit the diagram using keyboard. It is also possible to configure new commands and key combinations.
- **Automatic Layout** - Automatic layouts are used to arrange nodes automatically based on a predefined layout logic. There is built-in support for organizational chart layout, hierarchical tree layout, symmetric layout, radial tree layout, and mind map layout.
- **Overview Panel** -  The overview panel is used to improve navigation experience when exploring large diagrams.
- **SymbolPalettes** - The symbol palette is a gallery of reusable symbols and nodes that can be dragged and dropped on the surface of a diagram.
- **Rulers** - The ruler provides horizontal and vertical guides for measuring diagram objects in diagram control.
- **Serialization** - When saved in JSON format a diagram’s state persists, and then it can be loaded back using serialization.
- **Exporting and Printing** - Diagrams can be exported as .png, .jpeg, .bmp, and .svg image files, and can also be printed as documents.
- **Gridlines** - Gridlines are the pattern of lines drawn behind diagram elements. It provides a visual guidance while dragging or arranging the objects on a diagram surface.
- **Page Layout** - The drawing surface can be configured to page-like appearance using page size, orientation, and margins.
- **Context Menu** - Frequently used commands can easily be mapped to the context menu.
